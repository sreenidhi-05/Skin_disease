This project implements a skin disease prediction system using a Random Forest for classification and predefined VGG16 model for feature extraction .The model is trained and evaluated on a dataset containing images of only 2 particular diseases benign and malignant .
Approach :
1. Feature Extraction with VGG16 :
   We use the concept of Transfer Learning where we use a predefined model from Imagenet in keras .
   This extracts the features that are used as input for classification
2. Classification with random Forest :
   The extracted features are used as input to Random Forest classifier
   This predicts the type of skin disease
Prerequisites
Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed .
Dependencies
1.tensorflow
2.keras
3.numpy
4.matplotlib
5.scikit-learn
6.pandas
Dataset
The data consistes of skin disease images classified into 2 classes.
This consists of train and test folders.
Results
Model Performance
Accuracy : 84%
ROC(area) :0.92
Conclusion
VGG16 helps in extracting the deep feature which helps in classification performance
Random Forest part of ensemble learning uses multiple decision trees which train on subsets of images for classification
Achieves accuracy (84%) and strong AUC-ROC (0.92) ,making it an efficient model for skin disease prediction
